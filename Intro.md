# At the Start

### It all started when I needed to make a web page for a speech writing business. I took an HTML class and quickly discovered I needed programming to make anything happen.

#### My speechwriting website claimed:

 > It is not enough to be understood,
 > you must ensure that you can not be missunderstood.
