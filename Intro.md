# Tipping Point - Year 1999


#### My speechwriting website claimed:

 > It is not enough to be understood,
 > you must ensure that you can not be missunderstood.
 
 ### The desire to start a speechwriting business made me think I needed to make my own website to "get the word out".   I took an HTML class and quickly discovered I needed programming to make anything happen.  From there, it was a programming degree and my first job working for the state of Illinois as a programmer analyst which I had found in a printed newspaper ad in 2000.
