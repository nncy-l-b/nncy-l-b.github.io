Tech Route I Took

When I started college, I majored in speech communication and anthropology. Spoken and written language was the center of my focus. After working for a few years, I wanted something more and stumbled upon the language of computers - code.

In 2000, I started as a professional of code maintence, working for the state of Illinois with a client server application used by various organizations in Illinois offering adult education, GED, and ESL classes. As a sole developer of the application, I worked alone. Using a handle full of languages at work was enough for awhile.

In 2005, I decided to upgrade my skills at Northwestern University in Chicago with their Computer Information Studies program. This filled some the blanks and allowed me to transfer to Chicago. Exploring more languages, I decided I wanted something besides an 8:30 to 4:30 job.

As a 'project manager' for a small software company, I was working with clients end to end after the sale closed which included gathering requirements, importing data, customizing code, adding new features, creating daily data feeds, training users and providing on going support. The main task was client server, but one web project in c# and asp.net inserted itself.

With all the opportunities around me in the metro area, I wanted to make more cash and find something more.

In 2011, another client server development position came along with a team of five and no source control. It is an ongoing effort to code an enterprise app. As of 2019, effort has been made to start a replacement crafted in React, GraphQL, MySql and Node.
